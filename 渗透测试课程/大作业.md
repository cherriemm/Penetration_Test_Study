# Background





## Heartbeat

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)



> **Definion:** a periodic signal to indicate normal operation or to synchronize other parts of a computer system.

Usage : Provide high availability and fault toleranceof network services by detecting the network or systems failures of nodes or daemons which belongs to a network cluster administered by a master server

-- for the purpose of automatic adaptation and rebalancing of the system  by using the remaining redundant nodes 

- Usually sent at a regular interval in the order of seconds a **heartbeat message**
- If the endpoint not receive a hearbeat for a few heartbeat intervals , then the machine that should have sent the heartbeat is assumed to have failed.



## SSL/TLS

https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/https/what-is-https

HTTPS established an encypted link between the browser and the web server using **Secure Socket Layer (SSL)** or **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocols. TLS is the new version of SSL.



### SSL

> Standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between the two systems.
>
> SSL establishes an encrypted link using an **SSL certificate** (also known as a **digital certificate**)



**Data transfer over SSL**

**Two Steps**

1. the **SSL handshake**
2. the **actual data transfer**



#### SSL handshake

> an asymmetric cryptography which allows the browser to verify the web server, get the public key and establish a secure connection before the beginning of the actual data transfer.
